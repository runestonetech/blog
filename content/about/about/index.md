Runestone is an opinionated technology blog and documentation site created by t.noyes ([blackfeather](https://github.com/blackfeather9)).

My goal is to write good notes, share my projects, and build better habits along the way. I hope to decode some of the complexity of technology, and inspire other curious tinkerers and crows. This is a work in progress.

### Tech Stack:

Runestone is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I write content with [VScodium](https://vscodium.com/), and build the site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [poison](https://github.com/lukeorth/poison) theme.

You can save an offline copy of all my content by [cloning the repo](https://github.com/runestonetech/runestonetech.github.io).
